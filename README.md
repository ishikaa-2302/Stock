A fully responsive dynamic webpage which takes the data from Json format and displays itself in a graph. 
It is built with different features like searching and filtering to dynamically view the data in the graph and table  


SIMPLE DESIGN CRITERIA
1. The file contains mainly 2 webpage : one to display the graph and other to filter and search the data sets
2. The graph containing file is named as : line.html
3. The search file is name as : search2.php
4. The filter file is name as : monthdate.php


METHODS
1. The graph webpage extracts information from json file provided and displays data in 2 graph formats : line and bar graph
2. The filterTable() method in search2.php lets you filter the dataset by months and display it in the form of table
3. The filterTable() method also helps us to search the dataset by different 'symbols' and display in the table


DATA STRUCTURES USED 
1. Arrays to store the data in the database
2. Tables to view the information based on user search and filters given 


INSTRUCTION TO SETUP AND RUN THE SOLUTION
1. Install Xampp server on your device.
2. You need to create a database in order to view reults while filtering : name the database as 'testing' and create a table named 'stock2'
3. In the table add the following columns : 'close', 'high','low','open','symbol',volume','dated'
4. Run localhost by giving the following URL : https/localhost/NORTHERN TRUST/
5. View the files : to display graph : line.html and to display filter : search2.php


THE FILES MIGHT TAKE LONGER THAN USUAL TO UPLOAD BECAUSE OF LARGE DATASET, PLEASE BE PATIENT. 
IN CASE, THE WEB SERVER FAILS TO FUNCTION OR CRASHES IN BETWEEN, WE HAVE ATTACHED MEDIA SUPPORTING ALL THE TEST CASES, PLEASE REFER TO THEM.
